# ü•ß Raspberry Pi Server

> Stop writing custom scripts and worrying about deploying and scheduling them to run on your Pi. Instead, interact with your Pi through RESTful services - using whatever technology you'd like.

`raspberry-pi-server` is a server component designed to be ran on a Raspberry Pi which provides RESTful services to control the GPIO pins of the Raspberry Pi. This project was created in an effort to eliminate the need to create custom python scripts and constantly maintain, update, and schedule them on a Raspberry Pi. Rather, you can deploy one single service on the Pi (raspberry-pi-server), and never have to logon to the Pi again. Interaction to the Pi can be done through RESTful services using whatever client/technology you'd like. For example, check out the [raspberry-pi-client project](https://github.com/rustygreen/raspberry-pi-client)

## üèÅ Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get the service running on your Pi.

### Quick Start

You can follow the manual steps below to get the server running on your Pi or you can execute the shell script to install the dependencies and run the server:

```bash
sudo curl -fL https://github.com/rustygreen/raspberry-pi-server/blob/main/setup.sh | sh -
```

### Raspberry Pi Setup

1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/) on your Raspberry Pi

```bash
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install git
```

2. Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) and [Pip 3](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) on your Raspberry Pi

```bash
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install python3 idle3 pip3
```

### Deploy Server to Pi

2. Clone the repository

```bash
$ cd /home/pi # Or wherever you want to store your code.
$ git clone https://github.com/rustygreen/raspberry-pi-server.git
```

3. Install Python dependencies

```bash
$ cd raspberry-pi-server
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run Server

```bash
$ sudo python3 server.py
```

5. Consume the services

Returns a list of pins and their state (1 or 0)

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:8080/pins
```

Returns the state for GPIO pin #7

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:8080/pins/7
```

Sets the state of GPIO pin #7 to 1 (high)

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:8080/pins/7/1
```

You should get back a JSON list of the GPIO pins and their current state.

### Usage

Once the server is running you will have a number of services available to interact with your Pi GPIO pins. Below are a few examples:

## TODOs

- [ ] Add unit tests
- [ ] Add socket.io
- [ ] Add swagger docs
- [ ] Create Docker image and compose file
- [ ] Update docs to show Docker use
- [ ] Add other Raspberry Pi commands (restart, etc.)
- [ ] Finish documentation
